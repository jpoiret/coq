Supplementary material
----------------------

For instructions on how to build this Coq version, please see `INSTALL.md`.

The new prelude is contained in `theories/`, and will be checked be `make
world`.  The tests for `setoid_rewrite` are contained in the file
`test-suite/success/setoid_test.v`.  You are encouraged to use CoqIDE, built
alongside Coq, to browse and check the source yourself, with the command
`coqide`.
